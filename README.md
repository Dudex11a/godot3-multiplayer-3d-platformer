This is was my first attempt at making a Online 3D Platformer for a project I'm currently working on called Pal'n Around. I stopped working on this version of the project because I wanted to use Godot 4 for my project instead as well as wanting to refactor the majority of the project. In retrospect I don't think basically restarting the project was a very good idea. Maybe I'd have the game released by now if I hadn't done that! Because I'm not using this project anymore it's free for anyone else check out and use.

The game is built using the game engine Godot 3.6.

Compiled versions of the game can be grabbed here [https://dudex.itch.io/godot-multiplayer-3d-platformer](https://dudex.itch.io/godot-multiplayer-3d-platformer)!

Some features that feel are notible in this project
- Local and Online / Network multiplayer.
- Picked up other objects (including other players).
- Player character color customization.

Also warning if you plan on going digging through the code, I'd consider this project a mess. This project is what made me realize just how important consistant code and file structure are to these kinds of projects.

Before making this repo public I reset the git repo because there was my own PIA within the repo and I didn't want to go through the process of clearing and confirming that each instance of PIA is removed after removing it. The last time I worked on this project before the current tracked changes was 2022.
